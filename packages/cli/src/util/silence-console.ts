/**
 * Run `fn` with `console.log/info/warn/error/debug` swapped for no-ops so they
 * cannot interleave with clack's in-place spinner re-render. Originals are
 * restored even if `fn` throws.
 *
 * Why: 0G Storage SDK and 0G Compute broker SDK both `console.log` directly
 * during their work (selected nodes, upload progress, broker tx hashes, etc).
 * When a clack spinner is running, every leaked log line pushes the spinner
 * down and the next animation frame draws a new spinner row, creating the
 * "100x stacked spinner" visual we saw on the WC init test. Suppressing these
 * during the spinner-active phases keeps the wizard output clean.
 *
 * Note: `chat.tsx` does its own process-lifetime console redirect to a chat
 * log file. That cannot use this helper because its lifetime is the whole
 * session, not a scoped wrap. Keep the two pathways separate.
